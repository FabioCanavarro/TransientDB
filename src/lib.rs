//! # EpochDB 🦀
//!
//! An intelligent, persistent, and concurrent key-value store for Rust,
//! designed to manage data with a lifecycle.
//!
//! **EpochDB** is an opinionated database engine built on the robust foundation of `sled`.
//! It's designed specifically for workloads where the relevance of data changes over time,
//! such as caching, session management, and real-time analytics.
//!
//! It provides a high-level, ergonomic API by treating data's **access frequency**
//! and **age** as first-class citizens.

/// This struct holds the connection to the `sled` database and provides

/// thread for handling TTL (Time-To-Live) expirations automatically.
///
/// When this struct is dropped, it will signal the background thread to shut down
/// and wait for it to finish gracefully.
///
/// This struct also holds 2 Arc<sled::Tree> directly instead of a single sled::Db,
/// since almost all of the functions uses the tree directly which requires the sled::Db to
/// constantly open each trees.
/// Passing trees from the struct deletes the constant need to open the trees
